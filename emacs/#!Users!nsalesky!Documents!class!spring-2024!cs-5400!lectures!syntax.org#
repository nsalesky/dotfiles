Syntax is the presentation of a program

* Abstract Syntax
Goal: abstract away arbitrary decisions in the surface syntax

Surface syntax: ~1 + 1~
Abstract syntax tree:

* Parser
Converts surface syntax into an AST

* Parsing spoken language
Sentences are formed out of parts.
- a _noun_ is an object
- a _verb_ is an action
- a _tiny sentence_ is a noun (object), a verb (action), and a noun (subject)

Example: "Steven eats food"
